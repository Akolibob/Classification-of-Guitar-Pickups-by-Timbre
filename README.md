# Classification-of-Guitar-Pickups-by-Timbre

This is a project that I started for my undergraduate coursework that I am actively developing to create a usable and comprehensive algorith for classification of electric guitar pickups by timbre.

## What is it used for?

The code is devided by sections
  - File Import
  - Feature Extraction of Audio Files
  - Machine learning model training (currently using kNN)
  - Evaluation of features and model and re-training

The code is made in a way that only certain sections of it can be used
